 Notes:
----------
1)  The dipole derivative needed for  IR intensities are calculated  with finite diference using Qchem's dipole moments. 
    The quality of dipole of dipole  moments printed  in Qchem standard output file is too low for finite difference, 
    therefore it is better to use  Qchem's scratch file "174.0"  which stores  full precision dipole moments. 

2)  The units used  in standard qchem output  file and in "174.0" are  not the same.  
     Standard qchem output uses  "Debye"  for dipole, whereas "174.0" uses a.u. (bohrr*electron).

    Conversion:  Debye2au  = 0.39343

3)  Dont forget to compile QChemRead.c:

    g++  QChemRead.c -o QChemRead
