Steps to calculate vibrational frequencies (and thermochemistry )  with DFTB

1)  Optimization and Calulcation of hessian
  Assuming that the structure is optimized  then  se  this "driver()" to generate Hessian:

      driver = SecondDerivatives{
        MovedAtoms ={-1:1}
      }
   
 This will  make DFTB to generate "hesian.out"   

2) Use the hessian printed by DFTB+ to generate vibrational frequencies with octave/matlab.  
   The file  "hessian.out" has a formating with un-even number of columns per line. 
   It needs to be reformatted before reading into octave: 

    bash do-Hessian2vector                  # converts "hessian.out" in "hessian_vec"  with 1-number per line/row 
    octave --no-gui-libs  octave-IR.inp  > octave-IR.out
    
    
* DFTB files: *  
    dftb_in.hsd                  # input file
    geometry-optimized.gen       # input geometry
    band.out   
    detailed.out  
    dftb.out   
    dftb_pin.hsd  
    hessian.out                  # output file with Hessian matrix
    
**bash  and octave files: ** 
   do-Hessian2vector             # bash script for  converting "hessian.out"  ->  "hessian_vec"
   hessian_vec 
   octave-IR.inp                 # octave  script for calcultion if vibrational frequencies from "hessian_vec" for CO2
   octave-IR.out
