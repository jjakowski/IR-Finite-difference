Steps to calculate vibrational frequencies (and thermochemistry )  with DFTB

1)  Optimization and Calulcation of hessian
  Assuming that the structure is optimized  then  se  this "driver()" to generate Hessian:

      driver = SecondDerivatives{
        MovedAtoms ={-1:1}
      }
   
 This will  make DFTB to generate "hesian.out"   

2) Use the hessian printed by DFTB+ to generate vibrational frequencies with octave/matlab.  
   The file  "hessian.out" has a formating with un-even number of columns per line. 
   It needs to be reformatted before reading into octave: 

    bash do-Hessian2vector                  # converts "hessian.out" in "hessian_vec"  with 1-number per line/row 
    octave --no-gui-libs  octave-IR.inp  > octave-IR.out
    
    

band.out   
detailed.out  
dftb.out  
dftb_in.hsd  
dftb_pin.hsd  
do-Hessian2vector 
geometry-optimized.gen  
hessian.out  
hessian_vec 
octave-IR.inp  
octave-IR.out
